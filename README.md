# learn-html-css-javascript
This repo starts with essential HTML and progressively builds CSS skills (including layouts with Flexbox & Grid) to create beautiful, responsive landing pages. It then dives into core JavaScript concepts—conditional statements, loops, functions (declaration vs expression), arrays & methods, objects & object methods—to make web pages dynamic and interactive.
